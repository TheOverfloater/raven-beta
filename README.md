# raven-beta
 The sandbox mod Raven Beta for Half-Life, which for me was a mod I made mainly for toying around with code and various entities. It doesn't have much to do with the Raven City mod, it got the name because it was originally a recreated source code for the "Raven City Beta" mod, which was an earlir iteration of Raven City from before the period it was public.
 
 This sandbox mod features the following:
  - Vertex lighting on models
  - Stencil shadow code based on the implementation by BUzer
  - Crappy old shadows from GLQuake
  - Binding the view to an animating entity like trigger_camera
  - Quake 1 model renderer(Valve broke this in Steam HL and will using them cause a crash)
  - Some recreated Quake 1 NPCs(same issue as above)
  - A snowfall effect
  - A shader-based black hole effect and entity
  - Fog effect
  
  - Some TFC and OP4 weapons that got recreated and reanimated
    - M249
	- Sniper Rifle
	- Desert Eagle
	- TFC Sniper Rifle(automatic)
	- TFC supernailgun
